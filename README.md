# Dynamic web development using Jakarta Server Pages

A simple example of the usage of Jakarta Server Pages to write and retrieve information from a SQL server.

## Project Overview

This is a demonstrational project showing an example of a website for companies to post various coupons.  This site utilized a SQL database to store all the user and coupon information, including an initial setup script.  The website also demonstrates some JSP functionality in generating dynamic pages and providing RESTful application functionality.

## Features

-Examples of JSP pages framed with HTML templates and dynamically generated code using JSTL tags.
-A RESTful server-side application that functions as a manager, retrieving and writing data to an Oracle SQL Server.  
-A setup script for the Oracle SQL Server which includes the setup of necessary tables as well as sample data.

## Installation

The latest version of the Java Development kit will be required to run this application as well as Oracle Database 12c and Apache Tomcat.  

## Usage

1. Ensure that Apache Tomcat and OracleDB are both running
2. launch the PageController class from the command prompt with Java.
3. Open the Index.html file from the Web Content folder and click the “Setup Project Tables” button.
3. you can view existing coupons in the “Submission Form” section of the header.
4. existing coupons can be viewed by pressing the “View Entries” button
